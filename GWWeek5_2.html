    <h2>A programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who creates computer software.</h2>

    <h2>The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.</h2>

    <h2>A range of occupations, including: software developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer,
        software engineer, computer scientist, or software analyst, while they do involve programming, also require a range of other skills.</h2>

    <h2>The use of the simple term programmer for these positions is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory simplification</h2>
